# onscripter-jh-rg35xxsp
[WIP] My ONScripter-jh RG35XXSP port

## bugs, todo  
* Not support HDMI display output
* Key mapping  
* Key and joystick event on same time
* Auto mode may be bad (keycode a)  
* Not support volume up / down, default volume 100 is too loud, change to 10 (#define DEFAULT_VOLUME 100)  
* Toolchain same as MIYOO A30, some so files exist for a30 but rg35xxsp not, be careful
